abstract = {
Curry is a multi-paradigm declarative language aiming to amalgamate
functional, logic, and concurrent programming paradigms.
Curry combines in a seamless way features from functional programming
and (concurrent) logic programming.
Curry's operational semantics is based on the combination of
lazy reduction of expressions together
with a possibly non-deterministic binding of free variables
occurring in expressions. Moreover, (equational) constraints
can be executed concurrently which provides for passive constraints
and concurrent computation threads that are synchronized
on logical variables. This paper describes in an object-oriented style
an abstract machine for executing Curry programs.
The machine is designed to provide a link for compiling Curry programs
into Java but it can also be a basis for implementations of Curry in
other (object-oriented) languages.
The main emphasis of the Java-based implementation is the exploitation
of Java threads to implement the concurrent and
non-deterministic features of Curry.}

  abstract     = {A logic grammar formalism called DCG (Definite Clause
                  Grammars), which has proved to be useful, is part of most
                  Prolog implementations. We develop two new logic grammar
                  formalisms called DCG' and lambda-HHG (higher-order
                  Hereditary Harrop Grammars) that can be used in
                  LambdaProlog implementations. The relations between DCG,
                  DCG', and lambda-HHG, and Prolog and LambdaProlog can be
                  summarized as follows: (1) The language Prolog, the DCG
                  formalism, and the translation of DCG into Prolog by Prolog
                  are classical. (2) The evolution from Prolog to
                  LambdaProlog is due to Miller and the advantage of using
                  LambdaProlog for doing natural language analysis is shown
                  by Pereira, and Pareschi and Miller. (3) We propose a
                  strongly typed variant of DCG (called DCG') for its
                  translation into LambdaProlog by LambdaProlog. It is a
                  first stage towards a more elaborate formalism. (4) A
                  formalism that is to DCG what LambdaProlog is to Prolog is
                  still missing, and also the way to translate it into
                  LambdaProlog. Such a formalism combines the advantage of

                  being grammatical and hiding the house-keeping operations
                  (like DCG) and of having higher-order terms as attributes
                  and providing a logical approach to context (like
                  LambdaProlog). lambda-HHG is such a formalism.},

The first mechanism directly extends syntactic unification through the introduction of a data type, whose (unification) semantics are specified through user-defined predicates. The second mechanism was utilized for the implementation of coroutining facilities, and was independently derived with optimal memory management for various Prolog extensions in mind. Experience from the application of both mechanisms to the realization of CLP languages, without leaving the logic programming context, enables us to reveal similarities and the potential with respect to this task. Constructive measures that narrow or close the gap between the two conceptual schemes are provided.",
